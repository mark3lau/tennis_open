# **BAOLAU RESTAURANT**

## <u>1. Introduction</u>
In this project, the objective was to build a Full-Stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. I will set up an authentication mechanism and provide role-based access to the site's data or other activities based on the dataset.
I decided to create a website for a Chinese restaurant called Baolau. The restaurant will allow users to register an account and log-in in the future once they've registered. They will also have the ability to make, view, update and delete their bookings. It will also contain information about the restaurant and a menu showcasing their cuisine.
This website is built for people who love Chinese cuisine and are interested in trying out the Baolau restaurant and making a booking for a dining experience.

## <u>2. User Stories</u>
As a user I want to be able to view the information about the restaurant and understand instantly what the cuisine is, the ethos of the restaurant and where I can find the restaurant.

I want to be able to view the menu of the restaurant so I can understand the food that's on offer.

I want to be able to register an account so that I can make bookings at the restaurant.

A clear home page describing the ethos of the restaurant and where you can find the restaurant.
A navigation bar with options to view the menu and register or log-in as a user.

## <u>3. Features</u>

### **Home page and restaurant information**
A clear and simple home page that captures the look and feel of a high-end Asian-themed restaurant with a hero image in the middle. There's a description of the food at the restaurant and information around how users can find the restaurant and its opening times. 
A navigation bar at the top allows users to view the menu in detail, register an account if they don't have one, or log-in if they do.

### **Menu**
Users can view the menu from the navigation bar in the header on a separate page, where the restaurant's starters, main and desserts are displayed.

### **View, Update and Delete your bookings**
User can also view their bookings and have the ability to update and delete any existing bookings. To update their bookings, users will be taken to another page where the form reappears that allows them to edit that particular reservation and return them to the view bookings page.

![delete-booking](static/screenshots/delete-booking.png "Delete Booking")

### **Logout**
Users can logout by clicking the logout link, which will take them to a new page that asks them if they're sure that they want to log out. When the user clicks sign out, they will be taken back to the home page and logged out of their account.

## <u>4. Future features</u>

* ### **Warning messages**
   To include a feature that flashes a warning message to users before they are about to update and delete a booking, and allows them to confirm or cancel the action.

* ### **Leave a review**
   Once users have logged in, to allow them the ability to leave a review of the restaurant and their dining experience, and for this to be displayed on the home page for new and old users to view and comment on.

* ### **Block double bookings**
   To allow the restaurant to block any double bookings at the same time for the same number of people. Or for the restaurant to specify how many tables are available at a certain time so that it blocks users from making a booking if the tables at the restaurant are full.

## <u>5. Color scheme</u>
I used a mainly blue and red colour scheme with an easy-to-read grey for the text. The red colour is synonymous with Asian culture and symbolises luck and prosperity. The lighter blue adds a nice contrast and fits in with the wall-tile image that is part of the heading of the restaurant.

## <u>6. Lucidchart</u>
I used lucidchart to structure the restaurant website and its various functions. Taking in the user's journey from the home page through the various options of registering an account to loggin in, and the functions to make a booking, and then to view, update or delete their bookings.

## <u>8. Testing</u>

   ### **Code validation**
   The code has been put through the [Python checker](https://www.pythonchecker.com//) and returned minor errors. Most errors contained lines of code that were longer than 79 characters and unnecessary white spaces which have been rectified.

   The CSS code has been checked via the [Jigsaw validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) with no errors found.

   ### **Test cases**

   * #### <u>Home Page and Menu</u>
      The user is taken to the home page with details of the restaurant displayed. In the header, there are links to the 'Home' page, 'Menu', 'Register', and 'Login'.
      In the footer there are 5 social media links for 'Facebook', 'Twitter', 'Instagram', 'YouTube', 'LinkedIn'. 
      A link to the menu takes the user to a menu page displaying the restaurant's starters, main and desserts. There is a prompt for the user to register an account if they don't have one already, or sign in to an existing account.

   * #### <u>Register An Account</u>
      When the user clicks on the 'register' link, they're taken to a new page which prompts them to input details for 'username', 'email (optional)', 'password' and 'password (again)'. If any of these fields are not filled in or filled in incorrectly, a warning message flashes to fill the field in properly. 
      If all fields have been filled in properly and the user clicks 'sign up', they're taken to the home page with a new navigation bar of options. 
      They can view the 'Menu', 'Make a Booking, 'View Your Bookings' and 'Logout'.

      ![register](static/screenshots/register-error-message.png "Register Error Message")

   * #### <u>Login</u>
      When the user clicks on the 'login' link, they're taken to a new page which prompts them to input details for 'username' and 'password'. There is also the option for a user to tick the 'Remember Me' box so that their device remembers their login details. Once they click Sign In, they're taken to the home page and their account.

      ![login](static/screenshots/login-error-message.png "Login Error Message")

   * #### <u>Make A Booking</u>
      When the user is in the 'Make a Booking' page, input fields are displayed for 'Name', 'Email', 'Contact Number', 'Number of People', 'Booking Date' and 'Booking Time'. If any of these fields are not filled in or filled in incorrectly, a warning message flashes to fill the field in properly.
      Once all fields have been filled in correctly and the user clicks submit, they're taken to the 'View Your Bookings' page with a success message of 'Your booking has been made successfully'.

      ![make-a-booking](static/screenshots/make-a-booking-error-message.png "Make A Booking Error Message")

   * #### <u>View Your Bookings</u>
      In the 'View Your Bookings' page, the user's new booking will be displayed below which has two button options, one to 'Update' the booking, and one to 'Delete' the booking.
      If a user clicks 'Update', they're taken to a new page with a new form to update the same information fields, and when the user clicks 'Submit', they're taken back to the 'View Your Bookings' page with their booking updated.
      If a user clicks 'Delete', the booking will be deleted immediately and a success message will be displayed indicating which booking has been deleted.

   * #### <u>Logout</u>
      If the user wishes to logout and click the 'Logout' link, they're taken to a new page that asks if the user is sure they want to log out and a 'Sign Out' button. If the 'Sign Out' is clicked, the user is logged out of their account and returned to the home page.


   ### **Fixed bugs**
   * I had not added the '<int:pk>' path converter on my 'update_booking' and 'delete_booking' url paths which meant these pages were not rendering properly and were throwing up errors. These were fixed once the errors were identified.
   
   * In my model I had not included the foreignkey attribute for users and therefore every user could view the same bookings once a new booking was made.

   * In my UpdateBooking view, I hadn't included the primary key from the key word arguments object and therefore the user wasn't able to update their bookings properly as their bookings weren't being retrieved and was throwing an error. This was fixed once the issue had been identified.

   ### **Unfixed bugs**
   There are no known unfixed bugs.
